# Transformers 

Welcome to  **Transformers**ðŸŽ‰ This is a progressive project where I aim to:

1. **Implement Transformers from scratch** to understand the core architecture in detail.
2. **Build projects and applications** based on Transformers for various use cases in natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and beyond.

This repository starts with my personal implementation of the Transformer architecture in a Jupyter Notebook and will grow to include a variety of Transformer-based projects and applications over time.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Overview

### Current Content:
- **`transformers_from_scratch.ipynb`:**  
  A Jupyter Notebook containing my implementation of the Transformer architecture from scratch.  
  - Includes core components like attention mechanisms, positional encoding, and encoder-decoder blocks.

### Future Additions:
- Projects based on **Transformer models**, such as:
  - GPT for text generation
  - BERT for language understanding
  - Vision Transformers for image recognition
- **Applications** utilizing Transformers, such as:
  - Text classification
  - Question answering
  - Summarization
  - Image recognition
- Interactive and production-ready programs powered by Transformers.
